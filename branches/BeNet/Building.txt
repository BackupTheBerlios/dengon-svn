Whisper BeNet 1.3
-----------------------------

- The IDE chosen for Building for Haiku is Paladin, There is a provided pld file.

- The static lib in lib/libsgb.R4.x86.a should be placed in /boot/home/config/lib with the name libsgb.R4.x86.a. This is the Santa's Gift Bag intended to be replaced by libwalter in the future. 

Once done that with open the pld file with Paladin and ALT-M should be all u need to do to build the application.
